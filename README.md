# Chords Generator App

This app allows you to do exercises on the position and composition of chords on the piano, including all the turns. Using the selection boxes below you can see all the chords contained in the application, with the corresponding picture of the location. On the pages to the right, however, you can do exercises by selecting a chord randomly
